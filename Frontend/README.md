Instructions for running the html app on a local server:

1) navigate to the directory containing tennisfrontent.html

2) run npm start (if this doesn't work try installing nodejs first)

3) note what port the server is running on (this should be near the bottom in green in the form "127.0.0.1:<port_number>"

4) go to your browser and enter "localhost:<port_number>" at the top.

5) click on the html file

6) have fun :)
